1. Create a new file
2. Put "#t" at the top (title tag)
3. On the next line, put a title for the guide, something like "Cook pasta", don't add "how to" or anything like that, and don't put a period at the end (same for the steps)
4. Leave the line under the title empty
5. Under the empty line put "#b" (by tag)
6. Under the #b, you should put the name of the person who wrote the guide, if you prefer not to, use "anonymous"
7. Empty line again
8. A #n (needed stuff tag)
9. Stuff someone needs to successfully perform the guide, like this (don't EVER start a needed stuff line without a * (it should ALWAYS be at the start)):
   * A pot
   * A stove
   * Water
   * Pasta
   * A fork
10. Under the empty line "#s" (steps tag)
11. And under that should be your steps, like this (but a little bit more detailed):
   1. Grab pasta
   2. Grab a pot and put it on a stove
   3. Put water in the pot
   4. Put pasta in the water
   5. Turn on the stove
12. You're done writing! Now save the file and submit a do a pull request on GitHub (or send us a message so we can add it).
